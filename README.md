Recipes for a weekend camp away.
A website that links from the homepage to three different recipe pages. 

The webpage will include;
H1 and H2 headers.
Paragraph tags (These may have the strong, em and u tag)
Ordered (ol) and un-ordered (ul) lists (li)
Image SRC.
Hyperlinks to pages within the webiste and to external websites.

Note to self - Need to use Branches. Got into a bit of a mess when trying to find a solution for images not loading on github pages. In the end it was under my nose and was the simplest of fixes, as I didn't commit and push the images folder (with the image files). Due to this, my commit history became clutered with, for example, Fix(homepage)Fix image src etc. I should of ideally made a new branch and tested until an actual fixed was succesful and then merged back onto the main branch. Will make use of Branches when I run into issues and need to test (So the main branch is not cluttered with unnesscary commits)
